<h1>FastCommand</h1>
A lib for creating commands easy & fast

<h3>Performance</h3>
Since it's still in developments I can't say anything about performance.

<h3>Why should I use it?</h3>
You can save time, because:
<ul>
    <li>You don't have to care about subcommands</li>
    <li>You don't have to insert command informations into the plugin.yml</li>
    <li>You can use your commands for both, BungeeCord and Bukkit / Spigot, if they don't contain dependent actions</li>
</ul>
Your code gets more organized, because you only have 1 Method per command / subcommand

<h3>How does it work? (for Developers)</h3>
